# Predicting-Creditworthiness and Default Risk

In this project, I developed a classification model to decide whether a new customer should be approved for a loan. Based on the data for the previous customers  and predictor variables such as Account-Balance, Payment-Status-of-Previous-Credit, Length-of-current-employment, Purpose, Credit-Amount, Value-Savings-Stocks, Age-years etc.  I analyzed whether the new customers would qualify for a loan.
